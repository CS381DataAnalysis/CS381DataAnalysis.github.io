### Business idea 1:
As a taxi company, or FHV company like Uber/Lyft, Which customer we should send promotion?
Company’s targets : maximize income or   maximize market share( the number of customers)?  So we may have two solutions.

### Implement steps:
#### Step 1:  think about dependencies.

Dependent variable : income.  
How to calculate income:  trips *fare_price.
Which hour on weekdays/weekend , we have the lowest total income(gross/net)?
Does promotion and income have a positive relationship?
The Confusion Matrix 
Expected Value :
EV = p(o1) · v(o1) + p(o2) · v(o2) + p(o3) · v(o3) ... 
   
#### Step 2:
Data cleaning: how many errors  or missing data
#### Step3

### Questions:
